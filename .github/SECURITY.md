# Security Policy / Responsible Disclosure

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository or related services, thank you — we take reports seriously.

Please report security issues to:
- **Email:** security@example.com
- **PGP key (optional):** <paste PGP public key fingerprint or ASCII-armored key here>
- **Preferred method:** Encrypted email to the address above with the PGP key provided.
- **Public issues:** Please DO NOT open a public GitHub Issue for vulnerabilities — use the email above so we can coordinate privately.

### What to include
To help us triage quickly, include:
- A short summary of the issue and the impact.
- Steps to reproduce (minimal reproduction preferred).
- PoC (proof of concept) if available.
- Affected versions/branches.
- Your contact info and whether you wish to be credited.

## Our Commitments / SLAs
We will:
- Acknowledge receipt within **48 hours** (business days).
- Triage the report and respond with next steps within **5 business days**.
- Work with you to coordinate disclosure timelines, and provide status updates as the issue is investigated and remediated.
- Provide a public advisory once a patch is available (unless you request anonymity).

## Scope
In-scope:
- This repository and any published packages/artifacts clearly tagged from this repo.
- Public-facing services hosted and maintained by this project.

Out-of-scope:
- Third-party dependencies or upstream services we don't control (we do, however, welcome reports that affect us and will coordinate mitigation where possible).
- Social-engineering or physical attacks against staff.

## Safe Harbor
If you act in good faith to help improve the security of this project, we will not pursue legal action. Please avoid privacy-invasive testing (do not exfiltrate private data), and follow these rules:
- Do not attempt denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- Do not access or modify data you are not authorized to access.
- Limit your testing to the minimum necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.

## Disclosure and Credit
We will coordinate an appropriate public disclosure and credit security researchers who wish to be credited. If you prefer to remain anonymous, indicate that in your report.
